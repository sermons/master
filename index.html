## Pitfalls in How <br> Christians Treat Money
1. **Compartmentalisation**
2. Negligence

>>>
+ **We** often refuse **think** abt money
  + feel it's **dirty**, wicked, worldly
+ Don't **learn**: earn, save, spend, invest
+ 2 **pitfalls** (related, not exhaustive)
+ (1) **compartmentalized** thinking:
+ to **church** / charity: generous, trust
  + **biz** finances: strict, transactional
+ **take** as much as you can get:
  + all's **fair** in love, war, and business
+ Donating to charity **entitles** me to

  + lost **~$15M USD** by pres **Paul Risser**
+ Didn't **steal** the money for himself,
  + fooled by **pyramid** scheme
+ Realized **wrong** + asked forgiveness,
