# Is Money <br> My Master?
## Luke 16:9-15
[Steve Johnson](https://unsplash.com/photos/0sPFjdcRhko "caption")

>>>
+ **most** of us would say, "no, no"
  + it's a **necessity** of life
+ Bible never said having money is **evil**
  + of **course** I love God more
+ Today's passage sets **bar**: what truly means
  + to **love** God more than money
+ Christ has **saved** us by His mercy,
  + **disciples** us to be faithful in all things,
  + and has **called** us to love + obey Him
+ So let's open up **Scriptures** together
  + and **direct** our attention to Jesus
+ **behold** the Lamb of God
  + who **takes away** the sin of the world

There was a rich man who had a manager, <br>
and charges were brought to him <br>
that this man was wasting his possessions.

And he called him and said to him, <br>
‘What is this that I hear about you? <br>
Turn in the account of your management, <br>
for you can no longer be manager.’ 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

And the manager said to himself, <br>
‘What shall I do, since my master is <br>
taking the management away from me? 

I am not strong enough to dig, <br>
and I am ashamed to beg.

So, summoning his master's debtors <br>
one by one, he said to the first, <br>
‘How much do you owe my master?’

He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ <br>
He said to him, ‘Take your bill, <br>
and sit down quickly and write fifty.’

Then he said to another, <br>
‘And how much do you owe?’

He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.4/5)](# "ref")

The master commended <br>
the dishonest manager <br>
for his shrewdness. 

For the sons of this world are more shrewd <br>

than the sons of light.

## Pitfalls in How <br> Christians Treat Money
1. **Compartmentalisation**
2. Negligence

>>>
+ **We** are ones who often refuse **think** abt money
  + feel it's **dirty**, wicked, worldly
+ So don't know how **use**, earn, save, invest, spend
+ We often succumb to 1 of 2 **lazy** ways of thinking:
  + compartmentalization or negligence
+ (1) **compartmentalized** thinking:
+ to **church** / charity we're generous, trusting
  + but **biz** finances are strict, transactional
+ **take** as much as you can get:
  + all's **fair** in love, war, and business

<!-- .slide: class="outline" -->
## Pitfalls in How Christians Treat Money
1. Compartmentalisation
2. **Negligence**

>>>
+ (2) **negligence** masq. as faith in God's protect
+ e.g., early 2000's **Foursquare** church denom
  + lost **~$15M USD** by pres **Paul Risser**
+ didn't **steal** the money for himself,
  + but **invested** into **pyramid** scheme
  + **fooled** by crooks who promised high **return**
+ realized **wrong** + asked forgiveness
  + but not **isolated** incident: many like it
+ in **trusting** env of church, we forget 
  + **shrewdness** praised by master in parable
+ We neglect to study **how** ought to **use** money
  + Here's where Jesus says sth super **confusing**:

And I tell you, make **friends** for yourselves <br>
by means of **unrighteous wealth**, 

so that when it **fails** they may receive you <br>
into the **eternal dwellings**.

[Luke 16:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ To yourselves make **friends**
  + out of the **mammon** of unrighteousness,
  + so that when it **fails**, 
  + you may be **received** into the eternal tents.
+ **Mammon**: Aramaic "that in which we **trust**"
  + not in OT, only here and parallel in Mt6:24
+ Money is not **amoral**, it can be **unrighteous**
  + but even **if** we have unrighteous money
  + it can be **used** for better purposes:
+ Money will certainly **fail** us (die, quit, end)
  + but we have a **home** that lasts to **eternity**
+ "Dwelling": not **house** but **tent**, as Isr. in wilder.
  + rather **corner** of tent God's eternal king.
  + than **mansion** on fleeting worldly riches

---
<!-- .slide: class="outline" -->
## Making Friends Using Wealth
1. Make Peace with **God**
2. Support the **Saints** in Their Need
3. Show Mercy to **Business Partners**

>>>
+ So **who** are these **friends** I am to make?
+ **friends** (kiss, love, alliance, tribe):
  + who would **welcome** me to eternal tents
+ just as the dishonest **mgr** prepared to jump ship
  + and was **welcomed** into other households
+ 3 levels of **application**: God, saints, and the world
+ (1) make peace w/ **God**:
  + **all** our resources come from God
  + we **tithe** + offer as part of our **worship**
+ (2) **saints** that go before: support in their need
+ (3) **biz partners**: that may recog. witness of mercy
  + and be **drawn** to Christ's mercy

---
(guan xi)
>>>
+ so Jesus wants us to **buy** friends?
  + mixing **biz** + **personal** sounds sketchy!
+ e.g., **bank** sends you **birthday** card + gifts
  + friends w/your **money**, not w/you!
+ cf **guanxi**: "hey we're **family**, give me a **discount**!"
  + bad if **abusing** rl to gain money: **selfish**
+ good if **expending** money to build rl 
  + and **testify** to God's mercy

# Do I seek to show **mercy** in business?

+ not only as **consumers** but also **employees**/ers:
