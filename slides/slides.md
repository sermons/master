# Is Money <br> My Master?
## Luke 16:9-15

>>>

1. mercy in business dealings (seems money still has use)
2. faithfulness in the small things (money || the smallest)
3. love God, hate money (hate)

##  (1-) 9: relationships over money
+ waste money vs use money to build rl
  + master (still son of this age) recognized diff
+ make friends (kiss, love, alliance, tribe):
  + (1) make peace w/ God
  + (2) saints that go before: support in their need
  + (3) biz partners, that they may recognize witness of mercy
  + and be drawn to Christ's mercy
+ cf guanxi: bad if abusing rl to gain money
  + good if expending money to build rl + testify to mercy
+ Q: show mercy in biz rl, in prep of eternal occupation

## 10-12: faithful in small things
+ least / unrighteous / others'
+ purpose of earning money? 
  + Mt 5 storing up treasure
  + 6 worry / anxiety about not surviving
+ no lack/scarcity with the Creator
  + breaks system of economics that predicates on scarcity / zero sum
+ be neither proud nor dissatisfied, whether rich or poor
+ cultivate faithfulness
+ e.g. care for plant / fish / dog/cat / child
+ e.g., participate in smgp before lead
+ financial stewardship as part of discipleship
  + having enough money != good stewardship!
  + "I earned it, so it's mine to spend"
  + Col3:22-24 work as for Lord
+ Q: in what "unimportant"/"non-spiritual" area have I not been faithful? 

## 13 (-15) master of the house
+ servant in house: master, manager, servants
+ heart (love vs hate)
  + mind/thinking/priorities (cling/hold closely vs look down / despise / think down / contempt)
+ Phar scoffed: not took offense, but looked down on:
  + "Jesus, you don't understand:
  + "we do love God, and also enjoy finer things of life"
  + "what's wrong with loving both?"
+ making lots of money means God is blessing you,
  + means you must be doing something right? 
  + prosperity gospel, MLM
+ exalted in men / defiled before God
+ unconsciously prioritize making money / work
  + when opportunity for increased responsibilities at work,
  + even if would take time away from family:
  + "of course I need to take it"
  + "it's for our family"
  + scare tactics: "do you want us to starve? "
+ Q: am I servant in household of God or household of money? 

## Exegesis
+ 8b the sons of this age
  + smarter beyond the sons of the light
  + toward the generation which is their own they are
+ 9 and I to you say, to yourselves make friends
  + out of the mammon of unrighteousness,
  + so that when it fails, you may be received into the eternal tents.
+ 10 least vs much, faithful vs unrighteous
  + 11 unrighteous mammon vs that which is true
  + 12 others' vs given your own
+ 13 no house servant is able two lords to serve:
  + for either the one he hates and the other he loves,
  + or the one he clings to and of the other he considers.
  + Not you are able to God to serve and to mammon
+ 14 Pharisees: what's wrong with both serving God and making good money while you do so? 
+ 15 justify/righteous selves before men
  + but God knows the hearts of you
  + that which in men is high/exalted
  + is defiled/abhorrent before God

## xrefs
+ Mt treasure is, heart also

+ Mammon: from Aramaic "that in which we trust"
  + not in OT, only here and Mt6:24:
  + treasures in heaven, eye as lamp of body
+ 18:1-8 if even unrighteous judge brings justice,
  + how much more so God to His elect
  + if even unrighteous manager does thus,
  + how much more so should we
