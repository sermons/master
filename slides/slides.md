# Is Money <br> My Master?
## Luke 16:9-15

>>>
+ **most** of us would say, "no, no"
  + it's a **necessity** of life
+ Bible never said having money is **evil**
  + of **course** I love God more
+ Today's passage sets **bar**: what truly means
  + to **love** God more than money
+ Christ has **saved** us by His mercy,
  + **disciples** us to be faithful in all things,
  + and has **called** us to love + obey Him
+ So let's open up **Scriptures** together
  + and **direct** our attention to Jesus
+ **behold** the Lamb of God
  + who **takes away** the sin of the world

+ (1) **mercy**: use resources 
  + to seek opp to show mercy
+ (2) **faithfulness**: and money is the smallest!
+ (3) **love**: for God demands **exclusivity**
+ ch starts w/**parable**: 
  + somewhat **perplexing** one:

There was a rich man who had a manager, <br>
and charges were brought to him <br>
that this man was wasting his possessions. 

[2](# "ref")
And he called him and said to him, <br>
‘What is this that I hear about you? <br>
Turn in the account of your management, <br>
for you can no longer be manager.’ 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

---
[3](# "ref")
And the manager said to himself, <br>
‘What shall I do, since my master is <br>
taking the management away from me? 

I am not strong enough to dig, <br>
and I am ashamed to beg. 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.2/5)](# "ref")

---
[4](# "ref")
I have decided what to do, <br>
so that when I am removed from management, <br>
people may receive me into their houses.’ 

[5](# "ref")
So, summoning his master's debtors <br>
one by one, he said to the first, <br>
‘How much do you owe my master?’ 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.3/5)](# "ref")

---
[6](# "ref")
He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ <br>
He said to him, ‘Take your bill, <br>
and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ 

[7](# "ref")
Then he said to another, <br>
‘And how much do you owe?’ 

He said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ <br>
He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.4/5)](# "ref")

---
[8](# "ref")
The master commended <br>
the dishonest manager <br>
for his shrewdness. 

For the sons of this world are more shrewd <br>
in dealing with their own generation <br>
than the sons of light. 

[Luke 16:1-8 (ESV) (p.5/5)](# "ref")

>>>
+ So does the master represent **God**,
  + and **we're** to be like dishonest **manager**?
+ Jesus **repeatedly** emphasizes
  + mgr. was **dishonest** (unrighteous)
  + didn't he **waste** master's money?
+ Jesus is using wisdom of the **worldly**
  + to prompt us to be even **more** wise
+ akin to parable of **unrighteous** judge in ch18,
  + who **hears** widow's case bc **persistence**:

---
Hear what the **unrighteous judge** says. 

[7](# "ref")
And will not **God** give justice to his **elect**, <br>
who **cry** to him day and night? 

[Luke 18:6-7 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ if even unrighteous **judge** brings justice,
  + how much more so **God** to His elect
+ if even unrighteous **manager** does thus,
  + how much more so should **we**
+ **what** did the dishonest manager do?

---
‘How much do you **owe** my master?’ <br>
[6](# "ref")
He said, ‘A **hundred** measures of oil.’

He said to him, ‘Take your bill, <br>
and sit down quickly and write **fifty**.’ 

[Luke 16:5-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Used his **master's** money
  + which was **entrusted** to him
+ to give a subst. **discount** to others
+ **Why?** bc he **knew** he would lose his job, so

---
I have decided what to do, <br>
so that when I am **removed** from management, <br>
people may **receive** me into their houses.’ 

[Luke 16:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ he would curry **favour** with other houses
+ and so secure a **future** position for himself
+ what's **amazing** is the master's response:

---
The master **commended** <br>
the dishonest manager <br>
for his **shrewdness**. 

For the **sons of this world** are more shrewd <br>
in dealing with their **own generation** <br>
than the **sons of light**. 

[Luke 16:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ The master is also a **son** of this world
+ And **understands** the manager's **intent**:
  + "I **get** it -- you're looking out for **yourself**"
  + "You're still **fired** (oh so fired)"
  + "but I would have done the **same** in your shoes"
+ **Why** did the master **praise** him?
  + orig **reason** for firing was **wasting** money:

---
and **charges** were brought to him <br>
that this man was **wasting** his possessions. 

[Luke 16:1 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ note: not **stealing** (embezzlement) but **scattering**
  + didn't really know **how**, they're just **gone**
+ **now**, mgr hefty **discounts** to **protect** career
+ **Why** does the master respect this?
  + this is the whole **point** of this parable:
+ **Relationships** are more important than money
+ Money: no **intrinsic** worth; proxy for **value**
  + Money sitting in bank has **no utility**
+ How much **save up** doesn't reflect how **noble**
  + it's how we **spend** that reveals **values**
+ Sons this **age** understand **better** than we:

---
>>>
+ **We** are ones who often refuse **think** abt money
  + feel it's **dirty**, wicked, worldly
+ So don't know how **use**, earn, save, invest, spend
+ We often succumb to 1 of 2 **lazy** ways of thinking:
  + compartmentalization or negligence
+ (1) **compartmentalized** thinking:
+ to **church** / charity we're generous, trusting
  + but **biz** finances are strict, transactional
+ **take** as much as you can get:
  + all's **fair** in love, war, and business

---
>>>
+ (2) **negligence** masq. as faith in God's protect
+ e.g., early 2000's **Foursquare** church denom
  + lost **~$15M USD** by pres **Paul Risser**
+ didn't **steal** the money for himself,
  + but **invested** into **pyramid** scheme
  + **fooled** by crooks who promised high **return**
+ realized **wrong** + asked forgiveness
  + but not **isolated** incident: many like it
+ in **trusting** env of church, we forget 
  + **shrewdness** praised by master in parable
+ We neglect to study **how** ought to **use** money
  + Here's where Jesus says sth super **confusing**:

---
And I tell you, make **friends** for yourselves <br>
by means of **unrighteous wealth**, 

so that when it **fails** they may receive you <br>
into the **eternal dwellings**.

[Luke 16:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ To yourselves make **friends**
  + out of the **mammon** of unrighteousness,
  + so that when it **fails**, 
  + you may be **received** into the eternal tents.
+ **Mammon**: Aramaic "that in which we **trust**"
  + not in OT, only here and parallel in Mt6:24
+ Money is not **amoral**, it can be **unrighteous**
  + but even **if** we have unrighteous money
  + it can be **used** for better purposes:
+ Money will certainly **fail** us (die, quit, end)
  + but we have a **home** that lasts to **eternity**
+ "Dwelling": not **house** but **tent**, as Isr. in wilder.
  + rather **corner** of tent God's eternal king.
  + than **mansion** on fleeting worldly riches

---
>>>
+ So **who** are these **friends** I am to make?
+ **friends** (kiss, love, alliance, tribe):
  + who would **welcome** me to eternal tents
+ just as the dishonest **mgr** prepared to jump ship
  + and was **welcomed** into other households
+ 3 levels of **application**: God, saints, and the world
+ (1) make peace w/ **God**:
  + **all** our resources come from God
  + we **tithe** + offer as part of our **worship**
+ (2) **saints** that go before: support in their need
+ (3) **biz partners**: that may recog. witness of mercy
  + and be **drawn** to Christ's mercy

---
>>>
+ so Jesus wants us to **buy** friends?
  + mixing **biz** + **personal** sounds sketchy!
+ e.g., **bank** sends you **birthday** card + gifts
  + friends w/your **money**, not w/you!
+ cf **guanxi**: "hey we're **family**, give me a **discount**!"
  + bad if **abusing** rl to gain money: **selfish**
+ good if **expending** money to build rl 
  + and **testify** to God's mercy

# Do I seek to show **mercy** in business?

>>>
+ students: school, interactions w/**classmates**
  + practical **dealings** w/people of the world
+ not **demand** from others to fullest extent of law
  + but seeking **fair** + equitable dealings
+ not only as **consumers** but also **employees**/ers:
+ e.g., office **culture**, **conflict** resolution
  + **hiring** practises, who we choose to do **biz** with
  + how **insurance** rates are determined
  + legal framework **sentencing** small crimes
  + **mkt rsrch** / survey accurate **repr** real pop

3. Loving God, Hating Money [(v13-15)](# "ref")

>>>
+ but showing mercy != being **naive**
  + e.g., former Foursquare pastor
+ being **profligate** w/resources God entrusts to us
  + doesn't show **trust** in God's protection
  + it shows a lack of **faithfulness**:

---
[10](# "ref")
One who is faithful in a **very little**<br>
is also faithful in **much**, 

and one who is dishonest in a **very little**<br>
is also dishonest in **much**. 

[Luke 16:10-12 (ESV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

---
[11](# "ref")
If then you have not been faithful <br>
in the **unrighteous wealth**, <br>
who will entrust to you the **true** riches? 

[12](# "ref")
And if you have not been faithful <br>
in that which is **another's**, <br>
who will give you that which is **your own**? 

[Luke 16:10-12 (ESV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

>>>
+ 3 **contrasts**: the least vs **abundance**
  + unrighteous vs that which is **true**
  + another's vs your **own**
+ Money is **tiny**, not of great / lasting value
  + Money can be **unright.**: ill-got, tempt to sin
  + Money is not **our own**, it belongs to God
+ But money can be **useful**: train up **faithf.**
+ Financial **stewardship** is part of **discipleship**
  + Having enough **money** != good stewardship!
  + "I **earned** it, so it's **mine** to spend"
+ e.g., child's **allowance**: daily **needs** provided for
  + but allowance is opp. to learn **responsibility**
+ e.g., JJ's **piggy banks**, birthday money
  + doesn't want to just **keep** it in bank, no use
  + but what to **spend** it on?

---
Therefore I tell you,

do not be **anxious** about your **life**, <br>
what you will **eat** or what you will drink,

nor about your **body**, what you will **put on**. 

Is not **life** more than food, <br>
and the **body** more than clothing?

[Matthew 6:25 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Truth is: **all** our money is like a child's piggy bank
  + no **lack** / scarcity with the **Creator**
+ This breaks our system of **economics** 
  + that predicates on **scarcity** / zero sum
+ So we have no **fear** / anxiety 
  + about not having **enough**
  + and no **pride** over having an abundance
+ All our **worldly** wealth is the **tiniest** of things
  + compared to the **riches** of God's inheritance
  + reserved for us in **heaven**:

---
Do not lay up for yourselves **treasures on earth**, <br>
where **moth** and rust destroy <br>
and where **thieves** break in and steal, 

[20](# "ref")
but lay up for yourselves <br>
treasures in **heaven**, [...] 

[21](# "ref")
For where your **treasure** is, <br>
there your **heart** will be also.

[Matthew 6:19-21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Investment with **best** long-term returns
+ cultivate **faithfulness** 
  + in even the **littlest** things
  + we've been **entrusted** with
+ e.g. **care** for plant / fish / dog/cat / child
+ e.g., participate in **smgp** before lead
+ be a diligent **student**, employee, spouse, parent
  + **not** bc that role gives you **meaning**
+ but bc our **Creator** who defines our purpose
  + calls us to be **faithful** + trust in Him
  + w/promise of **greater**, lasting reward

---
Whatever you do, work **heartily**, <br>
as **for the Lord** and not for men, 

[24](# "ref")
knowing that from the Lord you will receive <br>
the **inheritance** as your reward. 

You are serving the **Lord Christ**.

[Colossians 3:23-24 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ whiteboard @TWU, need freq **reminder** to

+ Don't work heartily in things that **oppose** God,

  + **abundant**, **true**, and will be **ours** to keep

---
The Pharisees, who were **lovers of money**, <br>
heard all these things, and they **ridiculed** him.

And he said to them, <br>
“You are those who **justify yourselves** <br>
before men, but God knows your **hearts**. 

[Luke 16:14 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not took **offense**, but looked **down** on:
  + "Jesus, you don't **understand**:
  + "we **do** love God, and enjoy **success** in life"
  + "What's wrong with loving **both**?"
+ Making lots of money means God is **blessing** you,
  + means you must be doing **something** right?
